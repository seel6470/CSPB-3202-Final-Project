    "## Short Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "For my project, I chose to teach a learning model to play the original Super Mario Bros. game for the NES. I utilized a library created by Christian Kauten called gym-super-mario-bros, which provides an OpenAI Gym environment using the nes-py emulator [(Kauten, 2018)](#references). The challenge is to beat as many levels as possible in the original Mario game for NES with the following rules of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, I will create a random agent (choosing actions randomly), then a heuristic agent that chooses actions based on a given strategy, and finally two reinforcement learning models to compare against each other: a proximal policy optimization (PPO) model and a Q-Learning model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between PPO and Q-Learning will be in their approach to policy optimization and exploration. PPO is a policy-based method that directly optimizes actions, mapping the best action to take for any given game state. Q-Learning is value-based, focusing on learning state-action values. Because of this, PPO is better at determining continuous action spaces, whereas Q-Learning is better suited for discrete action spaces. Since Super Mario Bros. would represent a continuous action space with fluid movement between frames, I would anticipate the PPO model to be more effective, but it will be interesting to compare the results of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal will be to create stable learning environments for both of these models and see how each agent performs in the game environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules of the Game\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the game is to avoid enemies and pits to reach the end of each level. One hit and Mario loses a life, starting over from the nearest checkpoint. Power-ups provide Mario an additional hit. The following page from the original game manual outlines the inputs Mario receives for the game:\n",

    "To optimize the learning process, I decided to use several wrappers for optimization. The idea for these optimizations came from a video by Sourish Kundu I used as the basis for the Q-Learning model implemented later in this project [(Kundu, 2023)](#references). The following additions implemented above along with configuring Stable Baselines to use the GPU sped up the learning process quite a bit and allowed me to train the model for 400,000 episodes over the course of only a few hours.\n",

    "Additional optimizations included downgrading from color RGB pixel values to gray scale values, reducing the image size, and stacking 8 frames at a time. The framestacking, when combined with the frame skipping, reduces the processing complexity of the model and at the same time allow it to interpret more meaningful game state changes than it would otherwise evaluate from every individual frame.\n",

    "With the default PPO model values, the agent is unable to clear the pipe at the 595 X coordinate. I allowed the agent to train for 100,000 episodes hoping it would figure out that keeping the A button held down would lead to a higher jump, allowing it to continue to the right. Unfortunately, after 100,000 iterations, the model instead runs directly into the first goomba over and over.\n",

    "I attempted to fine tune the learning rate using a scheduler, fine tuning the gamma and clip values, as well as included an entropy coefficient to encourage exploration to no avail. Even with a large entropy coefficient, the model was not able to get over the pipe by chance. In retrospect, this is consistent with the behavior with our random agent, as the chances of stringing together several A button presses while also holding right for forward momentum could be rather unlikely. Even with the addition of frame skipping, which causes the agent to perform an action for every four frames, the agent was unable to clear the pipe in any of the learning episodes.\n",

    "__Because of this, the agent always gets stuck at either the first or second pipe and accrues penalties for the clock ticking down with no forward progress, per the default reward structure. After 100,000 episodes, the agent seems to learn that in order to avoid this penalty, it is more optimal to run directly into the first goomba, receiving a smaller penalty from taking a death than the accrued penalty it receives from getting stuck at the pipe.__\n",

    "To counteract this, I added a new Gym environment wrapper that returns a new reward function. Learning from the heuristic agent, I believe Mario will both progress farther and avoid death more if he spends more time jumping.

This should hopefully incentivize the agent to continuously press the A button and increase the chances that it is able to clear any tall pipes.\n",

    "WIth only 27,000 training episodes, the Q Learning algorithm is able to take advantage of the height reward and is clearing the tall pipes and the first gap. Given enough iterations, I believe this algorithm would show similar, if not better results than our PPO algorithm. However, it took almost 24 hours to just get this number of iterations when I could get 20 times the number of episodes with the PPO algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the main difference between PPO and Q-Learning, besides the processing time, has to do with how they handle discrete/continuous action spaces, limiting the number of chosen actions may have improved the Q-Learning algorithm. Even though the game-state is continuous and the controls for Mario can be very complex and nuanced, the limitation of either Running right (right + B) or jumping right (right + B + A) in addition to the frame skipping would have hopefully simplified the gamestate to be more similar to a discrete action state and likely improved the performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, initial PPO algorithm was more prone to exploitation, which caused me to fine-tune the environment's reward value function and incorporate an entropy coefficient to encourage the agent to explore. In the same way, Q-Learning uses an epsilon greedy function that chooses a random action some of the time, taking the the action with the highest q-value the rest of the time. Using the more balanced reward function and set of actions taken from tuning the PPO algorithm assisted in stabilizing the Q-Learning model without as much trial and error. This was significant, especially given the the costly time to process the Q-Learning model as opposed to the PPO model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, optimizations I found for the Q-Learning model to decrease computational complexity, such as frame skipping/stacking, image size reduction, grayscaling and not to mention configuring the modules to use the GPU, were able to be applied to the PPO model, making it even faster and allowing me to run even more iterations to easily fine tune the parameters and check the results."

    "In the end the heuristic created a strong strategy for simplifying the model's action choices, and creating a set of custom actions to either run right, or run and jump right encouraged the model to control Mario similar to a real player, jumping over most obstacles and minimizing the chances for death by running into enemies on the ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing the custom reward function to encourage higher jumping and creating the simplified action list allowed both the PPO and Q-Learning agents to progress much farther than initially, and ensured stable learning that balanced both exploration and exploitation. Prior to these revisions, the model continuously exploited the reward mechanics to a point that it was not progressing further into the game and would eventually converge on a policy that either stayed in one position (either stuck at a pipe or jumping over and over) or killing itself to the firts goomba repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference in performance between the Q-Learning and PPO models was mainly down to processing complexity. The PPO model was simpler and was able to perform hundreds of thousands of training episodes in only a few hours, whereas the Q-Learning algorithm, while it was significantly more stable, took over 24 hours just to get to 50,000 training episodes. The benefits of the processing speed of Stable Baseline3's PPO library enabled me to see progress quickly and make adjustments as needed, whereas it was relatively difficult to figure out any problems with the Q-Learning algorithm until a considerable amount of time was wasted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the processing drawbacks, I was forced to consider further optimizations to improve performance which I could use to speed up the SB3 PPO model even more.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, I was able to implement the improvements made to the reward and action choices of the PPO model to further improve the Q-Learning model. Insights which would have taken days and weeks to gather if I simply used the Q-Learning agent alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be interesting to see how much the Q-Learning agent would improve given the same number of iterations the PPO model was able to make and compare them side by side. Additionally, I have seen other projects, like [this one by William Wei](https://github.com/yumouwei/super-mario-bros-reinforcement-learning), that use custom wrappers that are able to read and interpret the memory of the Super Mario Bros environment to be able to have even more information for the agent to utilize, determining the locations of enemies, blocks, pits, etc [(Yumouwei, 2023)](#references).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given additional time, I would like to see how well the agent would be able to improve with this information. This in combination with using random stage selection could also allow the model to be able to create a more generalized optimal policy that could assist in beating many levels of the game. As it is, my model seems to be making progress very slowly as it learns from trial and error as opposed to dynamically \"seeing\" information in the game state and choosing actions accordingly."
