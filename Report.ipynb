    "For my project, I chose to teach a learning model to play the original Super Mario Bros. game for the NES. I utilized a library created by Christian Kauten called gym-super-mario-bros, which provides an OpenAI Gym environment using the nes-py emulator (Kauten, 2018). The challenge is to beat as many levels as possible in the original Mario game for NES with the following rules of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the game is to avoid enemies and pits to reach the end of each level. One hit and Mario loses a life, starting over from the nearest checkpoint. Power-ups provide Mario an additional hit. The following page from the original game manual outlines the inputs Mario receives for the game:\n",
